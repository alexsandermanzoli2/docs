## Important Notes

<Warning>
  Deleting a lead is permanent and cannot be undone. All associated data including notes, history, and custom fields will be removed.
</Warning>

### Soft Delete Alternative

Instead of permanently deleting leads, consider updating their status:

```bash
PATCH /v1/leads/{id}
{
  "status": "unqualified",
  "add_tags": ["archived"]
}
```

### Bulk Delete

To delete multiple leads at once, use the bulk delete endpoint:

```bash
POST /v1/leads/bulk-delete
{
  "ids": ["lead_123", "lead_456", "lead_789"]
}
```

Or delete by filter:

```bash
POST /v1/leads/bulk-delete
{
  "filter": {
    "status": "unqualified",
    "created_before": "2023-01-01"
  }
}
```

### Data Retention

- Deleted leads are permanently removed after 30 days
- During the 30-day period, contact support to recover deleted leads
- Deletion logs are retained for 90 days for audit purposes

### Webhook Events

When a lead is deleted, a `lead.deleted` webhook event is triggered:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "lead.deleted",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "lead_id": "lead_xyz789",
    "deleted_by": "user_abc",
    "deleted_at": "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z"
  }
}
```
