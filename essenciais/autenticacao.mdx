## Overview

The Speedio API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Speedio Dashboard](https://app.speedio.com.br/settings/api).

<Warning>
  Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
</Warning>

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token

All API requests must include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://api.speedio.com.br/v1/leads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.speedio.com.br/v1/leads', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
  'https://api.speedio.com.br/v1/leads',
  headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Types

### Test API Keys

Test API keys are provided for development and testing:

- Prefixed with `sk_test_`
- Access to sandbox environment only
- No charges for API calls
- Limited to 1,000 requests per day

### Production API Keys

Production API keys are for live integrations:

- Prefixed with `sk_live_`
- Access to production data
- Billed according to your plan
- Higher rate limits

## API Key Management

### Creating an API Key

1. Log in to your [Speedio Dashboard](https://app.speedio.com.br)
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API Keys
3. Click "Create New Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name
5. Select the appropriate permissions
6. Click "Generate Key"

<Info>
  Make sure to copy your API key immediately after creation. For security reasons, you won't be able to see it again.
</Info>

### Key Permissions

You can restrict API keys to specific operations:

- **Read**: Access to GET endpoints
- **Write**: Access to POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- **Admin**: Full access to all endpoints

### Rotating Keys

We recommend rotating your API keys periodically:

1. Create a new API key
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Verify the new key is working
4. Delete the old key

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, never in your code:

    ```bash
    export SPEEDIO_API_KEY="sk_live_..."
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.SPEEDIO_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only">
    Never expose API keys in client-side code. Always make API calls from your backend.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="HTTPS Only">
    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests over HTTP will be rejected.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="IP Whitelisting">
    For additional security, you can whitelist specific IP addresses in your dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## OAuth 2.0 (Coming Soon)

We're working on OAuth 2.0 support for more advanced authentication scenarios. This will enable:

- User-specific access tokens
- Granular permission scopes
- Third-party integrations
