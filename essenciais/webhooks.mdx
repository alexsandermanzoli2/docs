## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in your Speedio account. Instead of polling our API, you can subscribe to events and we'll send you updates as they happen.

## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint

First, create an endpoint on your server to receive webhook events:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Express.js
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhooks/speedio', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-speedio-signature'];
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-speedio-timestamp'];
  const body = req.body;
  
  // Verify the webhook (see below)
  if (!verifyWebhook(body, signature, timestamp)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  // Process the event
  const event = JSON.parse(body);
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'lead.created':
      handleLeadCreated(event.data);
      break;
    case 'lead.updated':
      handleLeadUpdated(event.data);
      break;
    // Add more event handlers
  }
  
  // Return 200 OK to acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

```python Flask
from flask import Flask, request, abort
import hmac
import hashlib
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhooks/speedio', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    signature = request.headers.get('X-Speedio-Signature')
    timestamp = request.headers.get('X-Speedio-Timestamp')
    body = request.data
    
    # Verify the webhook
    if not verify_webhook(body, signature, timestamp):
        abort(401)
    
    # Process the event
    event = json.loads(body)
    
    if event['type'] == 'lead.created':
        handle_lead_created(event['data'])
    elif event['type'] == 'lead.updated':
        handle_lead_updated(event['data'])
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Register Your Endpoint

Register your webhook endpoint in the Speedio Dashboard:

1. Go to [Settings â†’ Webhooks](https://app.speedio.com.br/settings/webhooks)
2. Click "Add Endpoint"
3. Enter your endpoint URL
4. Select the events you want to receive
5. Save your webhook

### 3. Verify Webhook Signatures

Always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are from Speedio:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
function verifyWebhook(body, signature, timestamp) {
  const secret = process.env.SPEEDIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  
  // Prevent replay attacks
  const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  if (currentTime - parseInt(timestamp) > 300) { // 5 minutes
    return false;
  }
  
  // Calculate expected signature
  const payload = `${timestamp}.${body}`;
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  // Compare signatures
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib
import time

def verify_webhook(body, signature, timestamp):
    secret = os.environ.get('SPEEDIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
    
    # Prevent replay attacks
    current_time = int(time.time())
    if current_time - int(timestamp) > 300:  # 5 minutes
        return False
    
    # Calculate expected signature
    payload = f"{timestamp}.{body.decode('utf-8')}"
    expected_signature = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    # Compare signatures
    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected_signature)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Event Types

### Lead Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `lead.created` | A new lead was created |
| `lead.updated` | A lead was updated |
| `lead.deleted` | A lead was deleted |
| `lead.validated` | A lead's contact info was validated |
| `lead.enriched` | A lead was enriched with additional data |

### Campaign Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `campaign.started` | A campaign was started |
| `campaign.completed` | A campaign completed |
| `campaign.failed` | A campaign failed |

### Account Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `account.credits.low` | Account credits are running low |
| `account.limit.reached` | Account limit reached |

## Event Payload

All webhook events follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_1234567890",
  "type": "lead.created",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Example: Lead Created Event

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "lead.created",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "lead": {
      "id": "lead_xyz789",
      "email": "john.doe@company.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "company": "Company Inc",
      "phone": "+55 11 98765-4321",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Security

### IP Whitelisting

Speedio webhooks are sent from these IP addresses:

```
54.231.123.45
54.231.123.46
54.231.123.47
```

Consider whitelisting these IPs in your firewall.

### HTTPS Required

Webhook endpoints must use HTTPS. HTTP endpoints will be rejected.

### Retry Policy

If your endpoint doesn't return a 2xx status code, we'll retry the webhook:

- **Attempt 1**: Immediate
- **Attempt 2**: 5 seconds
- **Attempt 3**: 5 minutes
- **Attempt 4**: 30 minutes
- **Attempt 5**: 2 hours
- **Attempt 6**: 5 hours
- **Attempt 7**: 10 hours

After 7 failed attempts, we'll mark the webhook as failed and stop retrying.

## Testing Webhooks

### Using the Dashboard

Test webhooks directly from the dashboard:

1. Go to your webhook settings
2. Click on a webhook endpoint
3. Click "Send Test Event"
4. Select an event type
5. Click "Send"

### Using ngrok for Local Development

Test webhooks locally using ngrok:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server
ngrok http 3000

# Use the HTTPS URL as your webhook endpoint
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/speedio
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Idempotency">
    Handle duplicate events gracefully. Use the event ID to ensure you process each event only once.
    
    ```javascript
    const processedEvents = new Set();
    
    function handleEvent(event) {
      if (processedEvents.has(event.id)) {
        return; // Already processed
      }
      
      // Process event
      processEvent(event);
      
      // Mark as processed
      processedEvents.add(event.id);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Async Processing">
    Process webhooks asynchronously to return 200 OK quickly:
    
    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
      // Acknowledge receipt immediately
      res.status(200).send('OK');
      
      // Process asynchronously
      processWebhookAsync(req.body);
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    Log webhook errors but always return 200 OK for valid signatures:
    
    ```javascript
    try {
      processWebhook(event);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Webhook processing error:', error);
      // Still return 200 to prevent retries
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring

Monitor your webhook health in the dashboard:

- Delivery success rate
- Average response time
- Failed attempts
- Event history
